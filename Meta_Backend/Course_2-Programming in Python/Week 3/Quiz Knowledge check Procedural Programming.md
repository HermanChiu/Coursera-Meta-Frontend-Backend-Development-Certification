### 1. Which of the algorithm types below finds the best solution in each and every step instead of being overall optimal?

1 / 1 point

- [ ] Dynamic Programming


- [ ] Divide and conquer


- [x] Greedy


- [ ] Recursive
```
Correct
Correct. Greedy algorithms optimise at every step. 
```
### 2. Which of the following Big O notations for function types has the slowest time complexity?

1 / 1 point

- [ ] O(log(n))


- [ ] O(c)


- [x] O(n!)


- [ ] O(n^3)
```
Correct
Correct. O(n!) has the slowest time complexity. 
```
### 3. True or False: Linear time algorithms will always run under the same time and space regardless of the size of input. 

1 / 1 point

- [ ] True


- [x] False
```
Correct
Correct! This is the definition of Constant time complexity. Linear time is dependent on the size of the input. 
```
### 4. For determining efficiency, which of the following factors must be considered important?

1 / 1 point

- [ ] Time complexity


- [ ] Space complexity


- [ ] Neither of the two options above


- [x] Both A and B
```
Correct
Correct. Both time and space complexity are important
