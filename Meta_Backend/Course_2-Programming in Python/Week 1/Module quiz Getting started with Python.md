### 1. Python is a dynamically typed language. What does this mean?

1 / 1 point

- [x] Python does not require a type for a variable declaration. It automatically assigns the data type at run time. 


- [ ] Python requires that you specify the type of variable before it being assigned. 


- [ ] Python requires you to explicitly set the correct data type  and value before assigning a variable. 


- [ ] Python supports both functional and object oriented programming. 
```
Correct
Correct! When variables are declared in Python they are automatically assigned a data type.
```
### 2. How do you create a block in Python?

1 / 1 point

- [x] A block is created using a colon following by a new line and indentation


- [ ] A block is created by a new line


- [ ] A block is created using a semi colon and a new line


- [ ] A block is created using a semi colon and indentation
```
Correct
Correct – A block of code created by using a colon, new line and indentation. 
```
### 3. When declaring variable in Python, can a variable name contain white space?

1 / 1 point

- [ ] Yes


- [x] No
```
Correct
Correct! A variable must not contain white space.
```
### 4. How can a variable be deleted in python?

1 / 1 point

- [ ] The def keyword


- [ ] A variable cannot be deleted


- [x] The del keyword


- [ ] The remove keyword
```
Correct
Correct! The del keyword is used to delete a variable by typing del variable name. 
```
### 5. In Python, how can you convert a number to a string?

1 / 1 point

- [ ] enumerate()


- [ ] int()


- [ ] float()


- [x] str()
```
Correct
Correct! To convert a number to a string you need to use the str() function. This will change an int like 8 to “8”. 
```
### 6. An Integer - int in Python can be converted to type Float by using the float function?

1 / 1 point

- [x] True


- [ ] False
```
Correct
Correct! The float function can be used to covert a type int to a float for better precision. 
```
### 7. What is the purpose of break in a for loop in Python?

1 / 1 point

- [ ] To terminate the code


- [x] It controls the flow of the loop and stops the current loop from executing any further.


- [ ] The break keywork is used to debug a for loop. 


- [ ] The break statement will suspend the code until continue is run. 
```
Correct
Correct! The break keyword will stop the loop from executing and transfer the control to the next block of code. 
```
### 8. An enumerate function is used to provide the index of the current iteration of a for loop.

1 / 1 point

- [x] True


- [ ] False
```
Correct
Correct! An enumerate function is used to provide the index of current iteration of a for loop.
```
### 9. What will be the output of the code below:

`a = isinstance(str, "aa")`

`print(a) ` 

1 / 1 point

- [x] It will throw an error. 


- [ ]  `“aa”  `


- [ ] False  


- [ ] True
```
Correct
 Correct ! It will throw a TypeError as the correct format here must be

 isinstance("aa", str)  
```
### 10. Select all the valid input() formats among the following.

Select all that apply  

1 / 1 point

- [x] `name = input("What is your name? ")`  
```
Correct
Correct! This is the standard format for using input()  
```

- [ ] `"" = input("My name is: " + name) ` 


- [x] `input() ` 
```
Correct
Correct! The input() can work even without assignment to some variable.  
```

- [x] `input("") ` 
```
Correct
Correct! The input() can work even without assignment to some variable and an empty prompt  
```
