                Hair Day also offers makeup and nail services, prides itself on its warm and relaxing atmosphere and is best known for edgy hair colors and on-trend cuts. 
                The owner of the store, Pria, earned her certificate as a colorist and immediately started specializing in edgy, custom coloring techniques.
                The store was opened with Garry, her good friend and talented hairdresser.
