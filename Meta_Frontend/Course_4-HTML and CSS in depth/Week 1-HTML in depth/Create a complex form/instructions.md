# Summary

In this exercise, youâ€™ll create a table booking form for the Little Lemon website. The form will contain four fields; email address, date of booking, number of people and a checkbox to confirm agreement with the cancellation policy. The form will also have a submit button.

# Instructions

**Step 2:** Next, add four div elements; one for each input field. 

**Step 3:** In the first div element, add a label element and an input element for the email address. 
Ensure that you use the correct type attribute to the input element to apply client-side validation.

**Step 4:** In the second div element, add a label element and an input element for the date of booking. 
Set the type attribute to date to allow for a date picker to appear when the user interacts with the form.

**Step 7:** Add an input element to the label and set its type attribute to checkbox. 
Apply the required attribute to the element.

**Step 8:** After the fourth div element, add a button element and set its text to "Book Now". 
Set its type attribute to submit.

**Step 9:** For each input element, add a name attribute.

**Step 10:** Save the HTML document and open it in Live Preview.

**Step 11:** Click the date of booking field. Note the result.

**Step 12:** Type the word "hello" into the email address field. Set the date field to today and the number of people to 1.
